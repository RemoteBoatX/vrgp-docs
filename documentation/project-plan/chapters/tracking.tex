\section{Project meetings}\label{sec:meetings}

The initial plan was to have team meetings every week to plan the work for the upcoming week and review the progress of the past week as well as our overall project status and progress. These meetings do not require every team member to attend every single week. Depending on the workload in the specific weeks, the meetings can either focus on the project work or some leisure activities, or both. Throughout the project, we made sure to respect the meetings.

The further we move on with the project, the less discussions we expected in the meeting. As we are a large group of seven members, we want to keep the meetings almost exclusively organisational and only discuss urgent and important matters that truly concern everyone in the team. The work on the project is done in smaller groups to ensure productivity.
\\\\
In addition, we met with our customers once per week during the first month of the project as we had to gather a lot of information and discuss a lot of topics and decisions in the beginning. We then switched to bi-weekly meetings afterward and finally to monthly meetings in the end as the topics under discussion got less the more we progressed with and dove into the project. We had additional ad-hoc meetings with the customers to discuss urgent matters. Again, these meetings did not necessarily require the attendance of all team members every time, but rather certain roles to take part. We also agreed with our customers to prepare these meetings with an agenda beforehand as required by the course.

\section{Time tracking}\label{sec:time-tracking}

We created a table sheet for everyone to keep their working hours for the project per day updated.
