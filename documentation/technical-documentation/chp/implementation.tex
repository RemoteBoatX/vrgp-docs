\section{Technologies}\label{sec:technologies}

The languages and technologies used are mainly those imposed by the already existing Åboat infrastructure. For the vessel side (i.e. the actual system implementation that will run as a microservice along with the boat’s existing software), the technologies used are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item C++ and OpenDLV (microservices solution)
	\item WebSockets and WebRTC (communication protocols for data over the internet)
	\item Docker (container solution)
	\item Raspberry Pi, LIDAR, GPS, radar, compass, and other existing hardware equipment
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Additionally, there is going to be a web interface as a way to test the VRGP connection to the vessel. Åboat currently has a web interface capable of streaming some data from the vessel to the shore. That interface will be extended by this project. The technologies that will be used in this regard are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
\end{itemize}
