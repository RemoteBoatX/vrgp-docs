## LaTeX

To compile the LaTeX files, it is recommended to use the TeX Live distribution
which includes all packages. It can be acquired for Windows and other operating
system at [tug.org/texlive](https://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html).

To compile the LaTeX files such as the project plan and the technical
documentation, simply call `pdflatex <file-name>` from the command line.
