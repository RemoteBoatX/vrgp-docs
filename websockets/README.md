# WebSockets

This document contains all notes and other findings we made during getting
familiar with WebSockets. This should be mostly problems, answers to some
questions we had, and how to set up certain things in programs.

This directory _**SHOULDN'T**_, however, include code examples. Such code
examples should be kept in a different repository and linked to from here. For
small code samples, the code can directly be embedded into this README file.
