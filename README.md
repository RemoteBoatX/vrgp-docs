# Documentation files for the implementation of the VRGP

This repository contains all the documentation and other documents gathered
while working on the VRGP implementation project.

Documentation and documents could refer to:
- documentation about the existing code on the Åboat or the MOC
- documentation about tools (like code editors, languages, frameworks) used by
the team or by the existing implementations of the Åboat and the MOC
- documentation about other non-coding related things (like workflows, project
management, presentations, other team documents)

What the repository should __*NOT*__ contain is:
- code or other types of source files related to the project or the associated
  projects of Åboat and VRGP test implementations
